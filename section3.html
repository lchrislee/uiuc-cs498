            <h1>What's best for you?</h1>
            When comparing gas, diesel, and electric cars all together, we see a trend that appears to be in favor of electric cars. This is likely due to the low of energy from the combustion engine, either burning the fuel incompletely or losing energy through the form of heat.
            <br /><br />
            Consider whether the electric cars have a battery that is capable of providing these averages. The MPG-E is calculated based solely on how far a car is capable of driving if it were supplied a gallon's equivalent of energy. It is possible for an electric car to have a small battery that leads to less overall distance traversable than a gas-powered car.
